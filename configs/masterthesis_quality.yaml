              This study aims to evaluate the performance of a voice synthesis method. This experiment is expected to last between <b>20 and 30</b> minutes, but you are free  
              to take as much time as you need. It is strongly advised to <b>use headphones</b>. If you experience any technical difficulies, it is advised to use a <b>laptop or desktop system</b> and the web browser <b>Chrome</b>.

              <b>Procedure:</b>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>The goal of this experiment is to rate the percieved quality difference between two audio samples.</li> 
                <li>You will be presented with two sounds, <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> and are asked to rate the difference regarding specific voice qualities aspects in 5 increments.</li>
                <li>The relevant voice quality aspects are explained in the following audio pages using audio examples.</li>
              </ul>
